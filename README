# Introduction

Use Easy Dice to roll dice of your choosing.

* Variety of die types: D4, D6, D8, D10, D10x10, D12, D20
* Choose which dice to roll together. For example a D4 with two D8.
* Re-rolling of dice. Tap dice to select which ones will roll and which ones
  will stay.
* Adding up. Sums all the die face values.

# Building

The build process has a number of steps due to assets being rendered.  However
assets need only be rendered once, and rescaled per app.

To render assets using blender run the render script.

  $ ./render.sh

This will undoubtedly take some time.  You will find many new files in the
render/ directory.  These are the high resolution renders that will be rescaled
to get the assets that apps will actually incorporate.  To build the android
assets run mkassets.sh from the androidsrc directory.

  $ cd androidsrc
  $ ./mkassets.sh

At this point you can build the Android project in the usual ways.
